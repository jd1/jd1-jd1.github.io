      I'm a backend engineer with a passion for building robust, scalable systems and improving code quality across
      teams.
      My professional focus lies in cloud-native development, microservices, BLE tooling, and clean software
      architecture.  
      I enjoy mentoring, leading teams, and driving knowledge sharing through formats like exchange sessions and 
      Pair/Mob Programming workshops.  
      In my free time, I love experimenting with smart home automation and integrating various systems to make everyday
      life a bit more clever.

      I'm currently working as a software engineer at [CGI](https://cgi.com), helping teams deliver reliable software
      with purpose and precision.
